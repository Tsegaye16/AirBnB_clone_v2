Background Context
Ever since you completed project 0x0F. Load balancer of the SysAdmin track, you’ve had 2 web servers + 1 load balancer but nothing to distribute with them.

It’s time to make your work public!

In this first deployment project, you will be deploying your web_static work. You will use Fabric (for Python3). Fabric is a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks. It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell commands (normally or via sudo) and uploading/downloading files, as well as auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or aborting execution. This concept is important: execute commands locally or remotely. Locally means in your laptop (physical laptop or inside your Vagrant), and Remotely means on your server(s). Fabric is taking care of all network connections (SSH, SCP etc.), it’s an easy tool for transferring, executing, etc. commands from locale to a remote server.
